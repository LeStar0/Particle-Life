# Particle-Life
A simple particle Simulation using Pygame and Numpy

What is Simulated?
- Groups of Particles are created (distinguishable by color).
- Rules are defined that specify, which forces are applied between the members of each group (or the same group).
-  Particles either Push, Pull or have no effect on other Particles.

Depending on the defined Groups and Rules, interesting patterns emerge, Particles may find a stable state and lifelike form and figures
